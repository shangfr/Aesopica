几个淘气的孩子在水池边玩耍，浅水中正在游泳的几只青蛙映入了他们的眼帘，他们便用石头去打青蛙，以此作为消遣娱乐。甚至于，他们还打死了几只青蛙。最后，一只青蛙从水中伸出头来，说："住手！住手！求你们不要再打了。对你们来说，这是一个活动，可是对于我们来说，却是致命一击啊。"

## THE BOYS AND THE FROGS

Some mischievous Boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and, catching sight of some Frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they began to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed several of them. At last one of the Frogs put his head out of the water and said, "Oh, stop! stop! I beg of you: what is sport to you is death to us."

```{admonition} **Moral**
:class: tip
we should always respect the life of creatures that are different from us and be mindful of the consequences of our actions.

## 野兔与青蛙

:::{tab-item} 中文
有一次，众多野兔聚集在一起，哀悼自己的不幸命运，方方面面都遭遇危险，而他们却缺乏勇气和力量去掌握自己的命运。人、狗、鸟类和猛兽等都是他们的敌人，整日屠杀吞噬他们。一想到要忍受这样的迫害，他们都认为还不如一死了之呢。于是，他们下定决心、不顾一切地来到附近的池塘边，准备投水自尽。有一群青蛙正围坐在池塘边，听到兔子们那急促的跑步声后，青蛙们立即纷纷跳入水中。兔子中，有一只年长的兔子比同伴们聪明一些，"朋友们，快停下来，我们应该振作起来，不要再自寻短见了！你们看，这里还有一些害怕我们的动物呢，他们肯定比我们更胆小！"

```{admonition} **寓意**
:class: tip
不要因为一些不愉快和挫折就去逃避,适当的时候我们可以想想还有很多不如我们的人,我们应该努力,改正自己的不足,增加自信感。

## THE HARES AND THE FROGS

The Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own. Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily: and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives. Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighboring pool, intending to drown themselves. On the bank were sitting a number of Frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths. Then one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, "Stop, my friends, take heart; don't let us destroy ourselves after all: see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves."

```{admonition} **Moral**
:class: tip
It is important to recognize that others may be more scared of you than you are of them, and that being brave may help you overcome difficulties.

Once upon a time the Sun was about to take to himself a wife. The Frogs in terror all raised their voices to the skies, and Jupiter, disturbed by the noise, asked them what they were croaking about. They replied, "The Sun is bad enough even while he is single, drying up our marshes with his heat as he does. But what will become of us if he marries and begets other Suns?"

一只老鼠与一只青蛙建立起了友谊。但是他们并非十分相配，因为老鼠完全生活在陆地上，而青蛙则除了陆地上的生活外，还时常在水中生活。为了永远不分开，青蛙用一根绳子把自己的腿和老鼠的腿绑在了一起。他们在干燥的地面上行走时，一切都正常，可是当他们来到池塘边时，青蛙带着老鼠一起跳进了水里，一边游泳，一边高兴得呱呱大叫。然而，可怜的老鼠很快就被淹死了，并且尾随着青蛙漂浮在水面。这时，一只鹰发现了老鼠，猛然冲向水面，用鹰爪把他抓了起来。青蛙无法松开与老鼠绑在一起的绳结，于是也一同被抓走，成了老鹰的美食。

## THE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND THE HAWK

A Mouse and a Frog struck up a friendship; they were not well mated, for the Mouse lived entirely on land, while the Frog was equally at home on land or in the water. In order that they might never be separated, the Frog tied himself and the Mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread. As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well; but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in, taking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure. The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the Frog. There he was spied by a Hawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons. The Frog was unable to loose the knot which bound him to the Mouse, and thus was carried off along with him and eaten by the Hawk.

因为缺少一个统领者，青蛙们大为不悦。于是，他们派了一个代表去拜见朱庇特，请求赐给他们一个国王。朱庇特不屑于他们如此愚蠢的请求，便将一根木头扔到青蛙居住的池塘中，并且说这就是他们的国王。刚听到木头落下的声音时，青蛙们都吓了一大跳，纷纷潜入池塘深处；没过多久，当他们发现木头依旧静止在那里时，一个接一个地又游出水面来；不久之后，他们愈发大胆了，发现木头没什么了不起的，甚至于爬上木块，坐在它的上面。他们认为这样一个国王简直是对自己尊严的侮辱，于是又去求见朱庇特，请求把赐予他们的这个木头疙瘩拿走，再换一个更好的国王。朱庇特对此十分生气，便派了一只鹳去管制青蛙。结果，鹳一来到池塘里，便开始全力逮吃青蛙。

## THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Time was when the Frogs were discontented because they had no one to rule over them: so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to give them a King. Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast a log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be their King. The Frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and scuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool; but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it.
Thinking that a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one. Jupiter, annoyed at being pestered in this way, sent a Stork to rule over them, who no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the Frogs as fast as he could.

## THE OX AND THE FROG

Two little Frogs were playing about at the edge of a pool when an Ox came down to the water to drink, and by accident trod on one of them and crushed the life out of him. When the old Frog missed him, she asked his brother where he was. "He is dead, mother," said the little Frog; "an enormous big creature with four legs came to our pool this morning and trampled him down in the mud." "Enormous, was he? Was he as big as this?" said the Frog, puffing herself out to look as big as possible. "Oh! yes, much bigger," was the answer. The Frog puffed herself out still more. "Was he as big as this?" said she. "Oh! yes, yes, mother, MUCH bigger," said the little Frog. And yet again she puffed and puffed herself out till she was almost as round as a ball. "As big as...?" she began---but then she burst.

## THE TWO FROGS

Two Frogs were neighbours. One lived in a marsh, where there was plenty of water, which frogs love: the other in a lane some distance away, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the ruts after rain. The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there far more comfortable and---what was still more important---more safe. But the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move from a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy waggon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the wheels.

But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, "Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?"

A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked: Won't you pay me a visit? I can promise you a good time if you do. The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help. The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.
