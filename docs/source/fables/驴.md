## 驴和他的担子


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一个小贩养了一头驴，有一天，他买了一批盐，几乎全都驮到了驴的背上。在回家的路上，经过一条小河时，驴不慎落水。盐巴全都落入水中打湿了，其中一部分盐已经溶化，被水流冲走，所以，当他再次驮起盐巴，驴发现自己的担子明显轻了很多。然而，他的主人又赶着他回到镇上，买了更多的盐，添加到原有的那些货物上，重新出发。等来到小河边，驴再次掉入水中，又起来，如上次一样，驴背上的担子又轻了许多。主人察觉出了驴的鬼把戏，再次赶着他回到镇上，这次主人买了一些海绵，绑到驴背上。当他们又来到小河边，驴又故技重施，可是这一次，因为海绵遇水膨胀，等站起身后，他发现背上的担子更重了。

## THE ASS AND HIS BURDENS

A Pedlar who owned an Ass one day bought a quantity of salt, and loaded up his beast with as much as he could bear. On the way home the Ass stumbled as he was crossing a stream and fell into the water. The salt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so that, when he got on his legs again, the Ass found his load had become much less heavy. His master, however, drove him back to town and bought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and started out again. No sooner had they reached a stream than the Ass lay down in it, and rose, as before, with a much lighter load. But his master detected the trick, and turning back once more, bought a large number of sponges, and piled them on the back of the Ass. When they came to the stream the Ass again lay down: but this time, as the sponges soaked up large quantities of water, he found, when he got up on his legs, that he had a bigger burden to carry than ever.

## 驴和他的影子


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一次，某人为了夏日的旅行而雇了一头驴，于是，驴的主人跟在后面赶着驴出发了。烈日当头的正午时分，越走越热的他们停下来休息。行人想要躺在驴的影子下休息，可是驴的主人也希望能够躲避太阳的照射，不想让他这么做，因为行人只说雇佣了驴，没说要雇佣它的影子。而行人也坚持认为自己完全有权利控制驴的一切行为。他们争论不休，互相打了起来。就在他们打架时，驴逃之夭夭了。

## THE ASS AND HIS SHADOW

A certain man hired an Ass for a journey in summertime, and started out with the owner following behind to drive the beast. By and by, in the heat of the day, they stopped to rest, and the traveller wanted to lie down in the Ass's Shadow; but the owner, who himself wished to be out of the sun, wouldn't let him do that; for he said he had hired the Ass only, and not his Shadow: the other maintained that his bargain secured him complete control of the Ass for the time being. From words they came to blows; and while they were belabouring each other the Ass took to his heels and was soon out of sight.

一头驴发现了一张狮子的皮，于是就披到身上。他走出去吓唬其它动物，所有见到他的人和动物都把他当成了狮子，吓得四处逃跑。驴见自己的诡计得逞了，兴奋地大叫起来。狐狸听到了他的声音，立刻认出这是一头驴，于是就对他说："哦，朋友，这才是真正的你，是吗？要不是听到了你的声音，我也被你吓着了。"突然一阵风刮来，把驴身上披着的狮皮吹走了，驴子原形毕露。这时，动物们见此情形，又都跑回来，用木板和棍棒狠狠地打他。

## THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN

An Ass found a Lion's Skin, and dressed himself up in it. Then he went about frightening every one he met, for they all took him to be a lion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw him coming. Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in triumph. The Fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the Ass he was, and said to him, "Oho, my friend, it's you, is it? I, too, should have been afraid if I hadn't heard your voice."

## THE ASS AND THE OLD PEASANT

An old Peasant was sitting in a meadow watching his Ass, which was grazing close by, when all of a sudden he caught sight of armed men stealthily approaching. He jumped up in a moment, and begged the Ass to fly with him as fast as he could, "Or else," said he, "we shall both be captured by the enemy." But the Ass just looked round lazily and said, "And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have to now?" "No," said his master. "Oh, well, then," said the Ass, "I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any worse off."

## THE LION AND THE WILD ASS

A Lion and a Wild Ass went out hunting together: the latter was to run down the prey by his superior speed, and the former would then come up and despatch it. They met with great success; and when it came to sharing the spoil the Lion divided it all into three equal portions. "I will take the first," said he, "because I am King of the beasts; I will also take the second, because, as your partner, I am entitled to half of what remains; and as for the third---well, unless you give it up to me and take yourself off pretty quick, the third, believe me, will make you feel very sorry for yourself!"

## THE LION AND THE ASS

A Lion and an Ass set up as partners and went a-hunting together. In course of time they came to a cave in which there were a number of wild goats. The Lion took up his stand at the mouth of the cave, and waited for them to come out; while the Ass went inside and brayed for all he was worth in order to frighten them out into the open. The Lion struck them down one by one as they appeared; and when the cave was empty the Ass came out and said, "Well, I scared them pretty well, didn't I?" "I should think you did," said the Lion: "why, if I hadn't known you were an Ass, I should have turned and run myself."

一头驴和一只公鸡在牛圈里一起生活。不久，一只饿了好几天的狮子走过来，想要逮一头驴当饭吃。这时，公鸡站起来，扑腾着翅膀大叫了起来。假如真有什么东西能使狮子害怕的话，那一定是公鸡扑腾着翅膀的大叫声。而驴却因此而洋洋自得，心想如果狮子都不敢面对一只小公鸡，那就更不敢面对一头驴了。于是，他立即跑出去追赶狮子。然而，等他们跑远了，听不到公鸡的叫声时，狮子猛然转过身来，把驴吃掉了。

## THE ASS, THE COCK, AND THE LION

An Ass and a Cock were in a cattle-pen together. Presently a Lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall upon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow. Now, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of a Cock: and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled. The Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion couldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an Ass: so he ran out and pursued him. But when the two had got well out of sight and hearing of the Cock, the Lion suddenly turned upon the Ass and ate him up.

磨坊主和小儿子牵着一头驴到邻近的市场上，希望能给驴找到一个新主人。在路上，他们遇见了几个女孩子，她们笑着说："你们看见过这样的傻瓜吗，放着驴不骑，却要在尘土飞扬的路上走！"磨坊主心想，她们说得有点道理，于是就让儿子骑上驴，自己则牵着驴走。走了一会，他们遇到了几个老朋友，打过招呼后，朋友们说："你把儿子宠坏了，竟然让他骑在驴上，而你却在地上辛辛苦苦地走！让他下来，这个小懒骨头！这样才对他有好处。"磨坊主听从了他们的建议，便叫儿子下来，自己骑了上去。没走多远，他们又遇到一群妇女和孩子，磨坊主又听他们说："这个老头可真自私，自己舒服地骑在驴上，让那可怜的孩子一路跟着跑！"于是，磨坊主立刻又叫儿子坐到他后面。又往前走了一段路后，他们又遇到了几个路人，他们问磨坊主胯下的这头驴子是自己的，还是临时租的。磨坊主说是自己的，正要去市场卖掉驴。"天啊！"他们说，"驮着你们俩一路走来，这个可怜的牲口看上去已经筋疲力尽了，等它到了市场里，估计没人愿意多看它一眼。也许你们抬着它去市场更好些！""只要你高兴就好，"磨坊主说，"我们可以试一下。"于是，他和儿子一起跳下驴，用绳子绑好驴的四条腿，并用一根木棍挑起驴，最后父子俩终于抬着驴来到了镇上。这个场面有点不寻常，很多人围过来看热闹，大家都取笑他们父子俩，说他们太残酷了，甚至还有人说他们是疯子。他们接着要穿过河上的一座桥，就在这时，被吵闹声和自己的奇怪姿势吓呆了的驴，用力挣断了绑缚它的绳子，掉到河里被冲走了。不幸的磨坊主又气愤又羞愧，连忙夺路而逃。他终于信服了一个道理------努力取悦所有人，其实等于谁也没取悦到，反倒还丢了自己的驴。

## THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS

A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him. On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, "Did you ever see such a pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!" The Miller thought there was sense in what they said; so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side. Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, "You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! It'll do him all the good in the world."
The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind. They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, "What a selfish old man! He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!" So he made his Son get up behind him. Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion.
 He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell.
"Good heavens!" said they, "with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him. Why, you'd do better to carry him!" "Anything to please you," said the old man, "we can but try." So they got off, tied the Ass's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them. This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father and Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics.
They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned. Whereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home
again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.

## THE ASS AND THE MULE

A certain man who had an Ass and a Mule loaded them both up one day and set out upon a journey. So long as the road was fairly level, the Ass got on very well: but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his last gasp. So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the Mule refused. At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed. The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's, and he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double load. The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, "I have only got what I deserved: if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain."

## THE ASS AND HIS PURCHASER

A Man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like. When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses. The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?" "I don't want to put him through any more tests," replied the other: "I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself."

## THE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS

A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself.
Going up to him, he said, "What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat shows how well you live: how I envy you!" Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick. "Ah, my friend," said the Wild Ass, "I don't envy you any more: for I see you pay dear for your comforts."

## 驴和他的主人们


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
有一头生活在园丁家里的驴，过着艰辛的日子，不仅吃得少、干得多，还经常挨主人的鞭打。于是，驴请求朱庇特让他离开园丁，换另外一个主人。于是朱庇特派墨丘利去找园丁，让他把驴卖给一个陶艺工人，园丁照做了。然而，驴仍然像以前一样不满足，因为他现在过得比以前还辛苦。于是，他又请求朱庇特让自己离开第二个主人，再换另外一个。朱庇特又安排第二个主人把他卖给一个皮匠。可是，当驴一看到新主人的生意，就绝望地哭起来："为什么我总对以前的主人不满意呀！为什么不满足于自己的辛苦工作和微薄待遇呀？至少，我会慢慢地消耗至死，而现在，我就要在制皮桶里结束性命了。"

## THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS

A Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating. The Ass therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over to another master. So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid him sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did. But the Ass was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before: so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a Tanner. But when the Ass saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, "Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated? for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat."

## THE PACK-ASS, THE WILD ASS, AND THE LION

A Wild Ass saw a Pack-Ass jogging along under a heavy load, and taunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these words: "What a vile lot is yours compared with mine! I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work; and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs. But you! you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully." At that moment a Lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass owing to the presence of the driver; but he fell upon the Wild Ass, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.

## THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE

A certain man put an Image on the back of his Ass to take it to one of the temples of the town. As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the Image; but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly. At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further. His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, "Oh, you dunderheaded idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass?"

At the end of the day, when the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the Ass said to the Ox, "Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?"

## THE HORSE AND THE ASS

A Horse, proud of his fine harness, met an Ass on the high-road. As the Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster. The Ass held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence. Not long afterwards the Horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer. One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him and said, "Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud! Where are all your gay trappings now?"

An Ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when he suddenly took it into his silly head to choose his own path. He could see his stall at the foot of the mountain, and to him the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the nearest cliff. Just as he was about to leap over, his master caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back, but the stubborn Ass would not yield and pulled with all his might. Very well, said his master, go your way, you willful beast, and see where it leads you. With that he let go, and the foolish Ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side.

## THE ASS AND THE LOAD OF SALT

A Merchant, driving his Ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt, came to a river crossed by a shallow ford. They had crossed this river many times before without accident, but this time the Ass slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet, much of the salt had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the Ass finished the journey very gayly. Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the Ass, remembering what had happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the water, and again got rid of most of his burden. The angry Merchant immediately turned about and drove the Ass back to the seashore, where he loaded him with two great baskets of sponges. At the ford the Ass again tumbled over; but when he had scrambled to his feet, it was a very disconsolate Ass that dragged himself homeward under a load ten times heavier than before.

## THE LION AND THE ASS

A Lion and an Ass agreed to go hunting together. In their search for game the hunters saw a number of Wild Goats run into a cave, and laid plans to catch them. The Ass was to go into the cave and drive the Goats out, while the Lion would stand at the entrance to strike them down. The plan worked beautifully. The Ass made such a frightful din in the cave, kicking and braying with all his might, that the Goats came running out in a panic of fear, only to fall victim to the Lion. The Ass came proudly out of the cave. Did you see how I made them run?,he said. Yes, indeed, answered the Lion, and if I had not known you and your kind I should certainly have run, too.

One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found some Grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field. He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did. What is it?, he asked very respectfully, that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully? Yes, said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; it is the dew we drink! Try some and see. So thereafter the Ass would eat nothing and drink nothing but dew. Naturally, the poor foolish Ass soon died.

## THE ASS AND HIS SHADOW

A Traveler had hired an Ass to carry him to a distant part of the country. The owner of the Ass went with the Traveler, walking beside him to drive the Ass and point out the way. The road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely. So intense did the heat become, that the Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest, and as there was no other shade to be found, the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Ass. Now the heat had affected the Driver as much as it had the Traveler, and even more, for he had been walking. Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Ass, he began to quarrel with the Traveler, saying he had hired the Ass and not the shadow it cast. The two soon came to blows, and while they were fighting, the Ass took to its heels.

## THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THE ASS

One day, a long time ago, an old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell. They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them. What foolishness, cried one, to walk when they might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be. The Miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride. They had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by. Oho, what have we here? they cried. Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride. Though the Miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the Merchants. At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell. Look at the old fool, exclaimed one of them. Perched on the Ass, while that poor boy has to walk. The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him. They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. What a crime, cried one, to load up a poor dumb beast like that! They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them. They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide, said another. The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight. The Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river. The poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一头驴在森林里发现了猎人留下的狮子皮，便穿上它，藏在灌木丛中，突然冲出来吓唬那边经过的动物，一看到他，所有的动物都逃之夭夭。驴看到众多动物都跑，就像自己是国王一样，心里非常开心，不由得张开大嘴，发出刺耳的嘶叫声。一只狐狸和其他动物一样，跑着躲避，但他很快发现这是一头穿上了驴皮的驴，于是他叫着大笑。意义: 即使有时做得很努力，也不要只在看到自己受赞美和被别人佩服时得意忘形，因为你很快就会遭遇同样的遭遇。

## THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN

An Ass found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter. He dressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicket and rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way. All took to their heels the moment they saw him. The Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him, just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray. A Fox, who ran with the rest, stopped short as soon as he heard the voice. Approaching the Ass, he said with a laugh: If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me, too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray.
