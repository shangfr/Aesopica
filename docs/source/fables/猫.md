## 猫和老鼠


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
从前，有一座房子，里面的老鼠泛滥成灾。一只猫听到此事，便自言自语："那正是我要去的地方。"于是她走到那座房子里住下来，一只接一只地抓老鼠，然后吃掉他们。最后，老鼠们再也无法忍受下去，决定躲到自己的洞里，再也不出来。"这还真不好办了，"猫自言自语道，"若想骗他们出来，只能耍个花招了。"她琢磨了一会儿，然后爬上墙，用后腿钩住木桩倒挂下来，假装已经死了。过了一会儿，一只老鼠向外窥探，看到了挂在那里的猫。"啊哈！"老鼠大叫，"夫人，你还真聪明，不过，就算你假装成一袋粮食挂在那里，你也骗不了我们去接近你。"

## THE CAT AND THE MICE

There was once a house that was overrun with Mice. A Cat heard of this, and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one and ate them. At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there. "That's awkward," said the Cat to herself: "the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick." So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead. By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there. "Aha!" it cried, "you're very clever, madam, no doubt: but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you."

## THE CAT AND THE BIRDS

A Cat heard that the Birds in an aviary were ailing. So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the Birds. "We shall do very well," they replied, without letting him in, "when we've seen the last of you."

## 猫头鹰和百鸟


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
猫头鹰是一种非常聪明的鸟。很久以前，第一只猫头鹰开始在森林里扎根繁衍时，她召集起所有的鸟类，对他们说："你们看到这棵小树了吗？要是愿意听从我的建议，在它还没长成大树之前，就先毁掉它。因为当它长成参天大树之后，就会出现槲寄生，继而你们就等着被专门捕鸟的粘圈毁灭吧。"当亚麻种子第一次出现在森林里时，她又对鸟儿们说："去吃掉那些种子，因为这是亚麻种子，要是没有亚麻，人类就无法织网来捕鸟了。"还有一次，当她第一次看到弓箭手时，就提醒鸟儿们注意这是它们的死敌，因为人们会用带有鸟类羽毛的箭来射死鸟类。但是，鸟儿们并没有将她的话放在心上，正相反，鸟儿们还嘲笑她是个疯子。然而，当事实正如猫头鹰预言的那样依次出现时，鸟儿们开始改变自己的思想了，并且大大佩服并赞赏猫头鹰的智慧。由此，只要猫头鹰一出现，鸟儿们就会趋之若鹜，想听到一些对自己有益的忠言。不过，猫头鹰已经不再提出忠告，而只是百无聊赖地坐在那里，沉浸在自己心中的遐想之中。

## THE OWL AND THE BIRDS

The Owl is a very wise bird; and once, long ago, when the first oak sprouted in the forest, she called all the other Birds together and said to them, "You see this tiny tree? If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small: for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction." Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, "Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you." Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them. But they took no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom. Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.

一只猫抓到一只公鸡，并想方设法找出一个借口好吃掉他，因为不吃鸡是猫的一贯传统，而她也知道自己不应该吃鸡。最后，猫说："你总在夜晚打鸣，让人们不能好好睡觉，所以，我要吃掉你。"但是，公鸡却辩解说，自己为了人们的利益而叫醒他们，可使人们按时起床工作，若是没有了鸡，人们就无法准时起床工作了。"有点道理，"猫回答说，"不过，不管他们能不能准时开始工作，我总不能没有饭吃。"于是，猫就吃掉了公鸡。

## THE CAT AND THE COCK

A Cat pounced on a Cock, and cast about for some good excuse for making a meal off him, for Cats don't as a rule eat Cocks, and she knew she ought not to. At last she said, "You make a great nuisance of yourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake: so I am going to make an end of you." But the Cock defended himself by saying that he crowed in order that men might wake up and set about the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very well do without him. "That may be," said the Cat, "but whether they can or not, I'm not going without my dinner" ; and she killed and ate him.

## 鹰、猫和野猪


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一只老鹰在一棵大橡树的高枝上安了家；一只猫和她的孩子们在这棵树的树干上霸占了一个树洞；一只野猪则带着小猪崽住进了树根处的洞里。若不是猫诡计多端，他们可能会成为很好的邻居。猫先爬到老鹰的巢边，说："你和我都很危险呀！树下那头野猪，天天在树根处挖土，怕是想把这棵树连根拔掉，好轻而易举地吃掉我们的孩子。"猫用这番话吓唬了老鹰之后，又爬下来对野猪说："我必须要警告你，小心那只可怕的老鹰。她可是一直在伺机飞下来抓走你的孩子们，去喂小鹰。"猫也像吓唬老鹰那样，狠狠地吓唬了野猪一番。然后，她假装自己也很害怕，躲进了自己的树洞，当日再也没出来。到了晚上，她则偷偷地跑出去为孩子们寻找食物。老鹰吓得不敢离开自己的巢，野猪也吓得不敢走出洞来。就这样，老鹰和野猪以及他们的孩子都饿死了，而猫则用老鹰、野猪及其幼崽的尸体养大了自己的孩子。

## THE EAGLE, THE CAT,AND THE WILD SOW

An Eagle built her nest at the top of a high tree; a Cat with her family occupied a hollow in the trunk half-way down; and a Wild Sow and her young took up their quarters at the foot. They might have got on very well as neighbors had it not been for the evil cunning of the Cat. Climbing up to the Eagle's nest she said to the Eagle, "You and I are in the greatest possible danger. That dreadful creature, the Sow, who is always to be seen grubbing away at the foot of the tree, means to uproot it, that she may devour your family and mine at her ease." Having thus driven the Eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the Cat climbed down the tree, and said to the Sow, "I must warn you against that dreadful bird, the Eagle. She is only waiting her chance to fly down and carry off one of your little pigs when you take them out, to feed her brood with." She succeeded in frightening the Sow as much as the Eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk, from which, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by night did she creep out unseen to procure food for her kittens. The Eagle, meanwhile was afraid to stir from her nest, and the Sow dared not leave her home among the roots: so that in time both they and their families perished of hunger, and their dead bodies supplied the Cat with ample food for her growing family.

## VENUS AND THE CAT

A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and begged the goddess Venus to change her into a woman. Venus was very gracious about it, and changed her at once into a beautiful maiden, whom the young man fell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards married. One day Venus thought she would like to see whether the Cat had changed her habits as well as her form; so she let a mouse run loose in the room where they were. Forgetting everything, the young woman had no sooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was after it like a shot: at which the goddess was so disgusted that she changed her back again into a Cat.

## THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE OWL

An Owl, who lived in a hollow tree, was in the habit of feeding by night and sleeping by day; but her slumbers were greatly disturbed by the chirping of a Grasshopper, who had taken up his abode in the branches. She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her comfort, but the Grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder. At last the Owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid herself of the pest by means of a trick.
Addressing herself to the Grasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner, "As I cannot sleep for your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of Apollo's lyre, I have a mind to taste some nectar, which Minerva gave me the other day. Won't you come in and join me?" The Grasshopper was flattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at the mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted. No sooner had he got inside the hollow where the Owl was sitting than she pounced upon him and ate him up.

## THE PARROT AND THE CAT

A Man once bought a Parrot and gave it the run of his house. It revelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece and screamed away to its heart's content. The noise disturbed the Cat, who was asleep on the hearthrug. Looking up at the intruder, she said, "Who may you be, and where have you come from?" The Parrot replied, "Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him." "You impudent bird," said the Cat, "how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise like that? Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and yet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all over the place." "Look here, mistress," said the Parrot, "you just hold your tongue. My voice they delight in; but yours---yours is a perfect nuisance."

## BELLING THE CAT

The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day. Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said: I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful. All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming. All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?

## THE MONKEY AND THE CAT

Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to them how they got it. One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question. I would gladly get them, said the cunning Monkey, but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and I'll divide them between us. Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey ate them up. Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with Sir Monkey.

## THE CAT, THE COCK, AND THE YOUNG MOUSE

A very young Mouse, who had never seen anything of the world, almost came to grief the very first time he ventured out. And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures. I was strolling along very peaceably when, just as I turned the corner into the next yard, I saw two strange creatures. One of them had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine. You should have seen him, On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat. He walked about restlessly, tearing up the ground with his toes, and beating his arms savagely against his sides. The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that frightened me almost to death. Can you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother? It was nobody but the Barnyard Cock and the first one the little Mouse had ever seen. If it had not been for that terrible monster, the Mouse went on, I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled. I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming yell, and I ran for my life. My son, said the Mother Mouse, that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat. Under his kindly appearance, he bears a grudge against every one of us. The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn't harm you in the least. As for the Cat, he eats us. So be thankful, my child, that you escaped with your life, and, as long as you live, never judge people by their looks.

## THE CAT AND THE BIRDS

A Cat was growing very thin. As you have guessed, he did not get enough to eat. One day he heard that some Birds in the neighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So he put on a pair of spectacles, and with a leather box in his hand, knocked at the door of the Bird's home. The Birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how they were. He would be very happy to give them some medicine. Tweet, tweet, laughed the Birds. Very smart, aren't you? We are very well, thank you, and more so, if you only keep away from here.

## THE CAT AND THE OLD RAT

There was once a Cat who was so watchful, that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of his whiskers for fear of being eaten alive. That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready for a pounce. At last the Mice kept so closely to their dens, that the Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one. So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it, head downward, as if he were dead, holding himself up by clinging to some ropes with one paw. When the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position, they thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some misdeed. Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully. But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out to celebrate the death of the Cat. Just then the Cat let go his hold, and before the Mice recovered from their surprise, he had made an end of three or four. Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat, who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one. Rolling himself in flour until he was covered completely, he lay down in the flour bin, with one eye open for the Mice. Sure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To the Cat it was almost as if he already had a plump young Mouse under his claws, when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps, and had even lost a part of his tail to pay for it, sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived. Take care! he cried. That may be a heap of meal, but it looks to me very much like the Cat. Whatever it is, it is wisest to keep at a safe distance.
