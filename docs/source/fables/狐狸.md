## 狐狸和葡萄


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一只饥肠辘辘的狐狸，看见缠绕在高架上的葡萄枝挂着几串成熟的葡萄，就尽力向上跳，想要摘下那些葡萄。但无论他怎么努力，也是徒劳无功，因为他始终够不着那些葡萄。于是他放弃了，反而带着不屑一顾的样子走开了，边走边说："还以为那些葡萄已经熟透了呢，现在看来根本就是酸葡萄。"

## THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, "I thought those grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour."

## 狐狸和乌鸦


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
乌鸦坐在树枝上，嘴里叼着一块奶酪。这时，狐狸在观察乌鸦，转动鬼脑筋想得到那块奶酪。于是，狐狸走过去，站在树下，仰起头说道："我的头上有一只多么高贵的鸟儿呀！她的美貌天下无双，她的羽毛精致纤美。要是她的声音也像外貌和羽毛那样美好，毫无疑问，她真该成为鸟类的女王！"听到这番恭维，乌鸦简直受宠若惊，一心只想着向狐狸炫耀一下自己的歌喉，就"呱"地大叫了一声。理所当然，她嘴里的那块奶酪就掉了下去，狐狸立刻抓起奶酪，说："乌鸦夫人，我知道你的歌喉很不错，可你需要的是智慧。"

## THE FOX AND THE CROW

A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds." The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."

## 驴、狐狸和狮子


::::{tab-set}

驴和狐狸商量好一起去觅食。还没走出多远，突然看见一只狮子走过来，他们俩都吓得不得了。然而，狐狸却想出一条妙计，可以保全自己的性命。他立即跑到狮子面前，附耳小声地说："如果你答应放我走，我就能保证让你毫不费力地抓住那头驴。"狮子应允了他的提议，狐狸便引诱驴掉进了一个陷阱里，这是某些猎人为捕获野生动物而事先挖掘出的洞。狮子见驴已被俘获，再也逃不掉了，于是便转向刚才和他说话的那只狐狸，很快便抓住狐狸吃掉了，然后再慢慢地去享受陷阱里的驴。

## THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION

An Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together. They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened. But the Fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the Lion and whispered in his ear, "I'll manage that you shall get hold of the Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free." The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell. When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the Ass.

## 狐狸与鹤


::::{tab-set}

狐狸请鹤来吃晚饭，然而他所款待客人的，仅仅是一个大平底盘子里盛的一点汤。狐狸津津有味地舔食平盘里的汤，而鹤却无法用他那长喙吸食香喷喷的浓汤。鹤十分气恼，这让狡猾的狐狸十分开心。然而，没过多久，鹤回请狐狸吃饭，他在狐狸面前摆放了一只颈长口小的罐子，可以让鹤轻易地将长嘴伸进去。这一次，当他从容地吃着罐子里的食物时，狐狸却只能眼巴巴地看着，因为他根本无法够到罐子里诱人的饭菜。

## THE FOX AND THE STORK

A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savory broth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.

## THE FOX AND THE MONKEY

A Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh. "Why do you sigh?" said the Fox. The Monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honor of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men." The Fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! don't stop at any lie, sir; you're quite safe: I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."

## THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX

A Dog and a Cock became great friends, and agreed to travel together. At nightfall the Cock flew up into the branches of a tree to roost, while the Dog curled himself up inside the trunk, which was hollow. At break of day the Cock woke up and crew, as usual. A Fox heard, and, wishing to make a breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and begged him to come down. "I should so like," said he, "to make the acquaintance of one who has such a beautiful voice." The Cock replied, "Would you just wake my porter who sleeps at the foot of the tree? He'll open the door and let you in." The Fox accordingly rapped on the trunk, when out rushed the Dog and tore him in pieces.

## 狐狸和山羊


::::{tab-set}

一只狐狸失足掉到了井里，无论如何也爬不上来。一只口渴的公山羊来到这个井边，看见狐狸待在井下，便问他井水好不好喝。"好不好喝？"狐狸说，"这可是我有生以来尝过最好喝的水，你快下来亲自试试吧。"一心只想喝水的山羊信以为真，便不假思索地跳了下去，当他"咕咚咕咚"痛饮完，就不得不开始思考爬上井去的办法，可他也像狐狸那样一筹莫展。狐狸早有准备，他狡猾地说："我倒有一个方法。你用前脚扒在井墙上，再把后腿蹬直了，我从你的后背跳上井去，再拉你上来，这样我们就都得救了。"公山羊同意了他的提议，狐狸踩着山羊的后背跳出了井口，接着便大摇大摆地扬长而去。公山羊指责狐狸不信守诺言，没有把他拉上去。但是，狐狸却回过头来对公山羊说："喂，朋友，如果你的心眼能像胡须那样多，就不至于在没想清楚应该如何跳出井之前，盲目地跳下去了。"

## THE FOX AND THE GOAT

A Fox fell into a well and was unable to get out again. By and by a thirsty Goat came by, and seeing the Fox in the well asked him if the water was good. "Good?" said the Fox, "it's the best water I ever tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself." The Goat thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and jumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about, like the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none. Presently the Fox said, "I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs, and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your horns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too." The Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The Goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out: but the Fox merely turned and said, "If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again."

## THE SWOLLEN FOX

A hungry Fox found in a hollow tree a quantity of bread and meat, which some shepherds had placed there against their return. Delighted with his find he slipped in through the narrow aperture and greedily devoured it all. But when he tried to get out again he found himself so swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the hole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune. Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was; and, on learning the state of the case, said, "Well, my friend, I see nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink to your former size; you'll get out then easily enough."

有一只狐狸曾经落入捕兽器的圈套，经过一番斗争，他终于逃脱了，但却失去了一条尾巴。经此劫难，他觉得自己脸上无光，还不如一死了之，除非能够劝说其它狐狸也舍弃自己的尾巴，这样大家就不会再关注他的断尾了。于是他召集了所有狐狸开会，劝说他们也割掉自己的尾巴，他当众宣称："你们的尾巴实在太难看了，一直带着尾巴四处走，这简直太让人厌恶了。"然而，有一只狐狸站出来反驳道："喂，朋友，如果你没有丢掉自己的尾巴，就不会这样煞费苦心地来劝说我们了。"

## THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL

A fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get free, but with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also, and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: "They're ugly things anyhow," he said, "and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be always carrying them about with you." But one of the other Foxes said, "My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you wouldn't be so keen on getting us to cut off ours."

## THE FOX AND THE LION

A Fox who had never seen a Lion one day met one, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he was ready to die with fear. After a time he met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so much as he had been when he met him first. But when he saw him for the third time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and began to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.

A Bear was once bragging about his generous feelings, and saying how refined he was compared with other animals. (There is, in fact, a tradition that a Bear will never touch a dead body.)

## THE LION, THE BEAR, AND THE FOX

A Lion and a Bear were fighting for possession of a kid, which they had both seized at the same moment. The battle was long and fierce, and at length both of them were exhausted, and lay upon the ground severely wounded and gasping for breath. A Fox had all the time been prowling round and watching the fight: and when he saw the combatants lying there too weak to move, he slipped in and seized the kid, and ran off with it. They looked on helplessly, and one said to the other, "Here we've been mauling each other all this while, and no one the better for it except the Fox!"

一只狮子躺在自己的洞口睡着了，这时，一只老鼠跑到他的背后搔他痒，好让他赶快从梦中醒来，寻找究竟是谁在骚扰他。在旁观察的狐狸见后，心想可以和狮子开个玩笑，便开口说道："我可是第一次看见狮子惧怕老鼠。""害怕一只小老鼠？"狮子说，"我才不怕老鼠呢！只是无法忍受他的无礼。"

## THE LION, THE MOUSE, AND THE FOX

A Lion was lying asleep at the mouth of his den when a Mouse ran over his back and tickled him so that he woke up with a start and began looking about everywhere to see what it was that had disturbed him. A Fox, who was looking on, thought he would have a joke at the expense of the Lion; so he said, "Well, this is the first time I've seen a Lion afraid of a Mouse." "Afraid of a Mouse?" said the Lion testily: "not I! It's his bad manners I can't stand."

A Wolf charged a Fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was brought before an Ape to be tried. When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: "I do not think," he said, "that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim; but all the same I believe that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials."

## THE FARMER AND THE FOX

A Farmer was greatly annoyed by a Fox, which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls. So he set a trap for him and caught him; and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go. As ill-luck would have it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting. It quickly caught fire and was all burnt up, and the Farmer lost all his harvest.

## THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE ASS

A Lion, a Fox, and an Ass went out hunting together. They had soon taken a large booty, which the Lion requested the Ass to divide between them. The Ass divided it all into three equal parts, and modestly begged the others to take their choice; at which the Lion, bursting with fury, sprang upon the Ass and tore him to pieces. Then, glaring at the Fox, he bade him make a fresh division. The Fox gathered almost the whole in one great heap for the Lion's share, leaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself. "My dear friend," said the Lion, "how did you get the knack of it so well?" The Fox replied, "Me? Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass."

## THE EAGLE AND THE FOX

An Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near one another: they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be. So the Eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs. One day the Fox went out foraging for food, and the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family. When the Fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her out for her treachery. So she sat down not far off and cursed her. But it wasn't long before she had her revenge. Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest. There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground. Then the Fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.

## THE FOX WHO SERVED A LION

A Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the Fox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions. But the Lion always got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all; so he determined to set up on his own account. He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him. The hunter was now the hunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.

## THE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE FOX

A Lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the Fox. The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill." Just then the Fox came in and heard the last words of the Wolf. The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness." "And may I ask if you have found one?" said the Lion. "I have, sire," said the Fox, "and it is this: you must flay a Wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm." The Lion accordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription; but the Fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comes of stirring up ill-will."

A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him; but the Fox replied, "Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now; but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins."

一群狐狸聚集在河畔，想要喝河里的水。但是，河里的水流很急，而河水似乎又很深、很危险，于是，他们都不敢下去喝水，只是站在河边，鼓动其他不害怕的狐狸下去喝水。其中有一只狐狸，嘲笑同伴们太胆小，为显示自己的勇敢，他说道："我才不害怕呢！看吧，我马上就走进河里去！"他刚步入河中，就被湍急的河水冲得站不稳脚跟。眼看他就要被河水冲到下游去了，站在河边的其他狐狸冲他大喊："别走呀，不要留下我们！快回来，告诉我们从哪里可以安全地下去喝水。"然而，被水冲走的狐狸却回答说："恐怕我不能回去了，我想到海边去，河水会带我过去的。等我回来后，再告诉你们吧。"

## THE FOXES AND THE RIVER

A number of Foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to drink; but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and dangerous that they didn't dare to do so, but stood near the edge encouraging one another not to be afraid. At last one of them, to shame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, "I am not a bit frightened! See, I'll step right into the water!" He had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet.
When the others saw him being carried down-stream they cried, "Don't go and leave us! Come back and show us where we too can drink with safety." But he replied, "I'm afraid I can't yet: I want to go to the seaside, and this current will take me there nicely. When I come back I'll show you with pleasure."

In making his way through a hedge a Fox missed his footing and caught at a Bramble to save himself from falling.

The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, "You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at others."

## 狮子、狐狸和雄鹿


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 中文
一只生病的狮子躺在自己的洞里，没办法亲自去寻找食物。于是，他对前来探望自己的朋友------狐狸说："我的好朋友，我希望你能到那片森林里去，用花言巧语把住在那里的一只最大的鹿骗到这里来，我很想吃掉他的心和脑子。"狐狸来到树林里，看见了那只雄鹿，便对他说："亲爱的朋友，你走运了。你知道我们的国王狮子吧，是的，他快要死了，可是却指名要你去继承他的王位，来统治百兽。我希望你别忘了，我可是第一个向你报告好消息的。现在，我必须得回到狮子那里去了，如果你肯听我的话，就和我一起去，看他最后一眼吧。"雄鹿非常高兴，毫不设防地跟着狐狸来到了狮子的洞里。刚一进来，狮子猛然朝鹿扑过来，然而，他错误地估计了自己的实力。雄鹿仅仅被撕扯掉了耳朵，他拼命地逃回树林里的避难处。狐狸很难过，狮子也很失望，因为生了病的他正在忍饥挨饿。于是，狮子请求狐狸再想想办法，用诡计哄骗雄鹿再一次到洞里来。"这次不太可能了，"狐狸说，"不过，我会再试试。"他又一次来到树林里，发现雄鹿正在休息疗伤。一见到狐狸，雄鹿就哭喊道："你这个大坏蛋，像那样骗我去送死，你到底什么意思？快走开，不然我就用鹿角刺死你。"可是，狐狸却恬不知耻地说："你可真是个懦夫，你难道真的认为狮子要伤害你吗？他只是想在你耳边说一些关于王位的秘密罢了，可你却像只受了惊吓的兔子一样跑开了。你已经激怒了他，我不确定他是否要将王位传给狼，除非你立刻回去告诉狮子，你不是这样的胆小鬼。我向你保证，狮子决不会伤害你，而且我也会做你的忠实奴仆。"愚蠢的雄鹿又被说服了，再次跟着狐狸回到狮子的洞里。这一次，狮子没有再犯错误，轻易地制服了雄鹿，美美地享受了一顿。在一旁静候的狐狸，瞅准了机会，趁狮子不注意时，偷走了雄鹿的脑子，以此犒劳自己。一会儿，狮子开始寻找鹿的脑子，当然找不到了。这时，在一旁观望的狐狸说："我认为寻找鹿的脑子是白费工夫，因为能两次走进狮子洞里来的动物，不可能有脑子。"

## THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG

A Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food. So he said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, "My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag, who lives there, to come to my den: I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains." The Fox went to the wood and found the Stag and said to him, "My dear sir, you're in luck. You know the Lion, our King: well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts. I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news. And now I must be going back to him; and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last." The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing. No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood. The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness. So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing the Stag to his den. "It'll be almost impossible this time," said the Fox, "but I'll try"; and off he went to the wood a second time, and found the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright. As soon as he saw the Fox he cried, "You scoundrel, what do
you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that? Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns." But the Fox was entirely shameless. "What a coward you were," said he; "surely you didn't think the Lion meant any harm? Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit. You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit. I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant." The Stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made no mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his carcase. The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble. Presently the Lion began searching for them, of course without success: and the Fox, who was watching him, said, "I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains: a creature who twice walked into a Lion's den can't have got any."

## THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX

A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of. At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably. With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely: A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends. I feel highly flattered, kind sir, replied the Cock slyly. If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in. The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.

## THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. What a fool I am, he said, Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off he walked very, very scornfully.

## THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION

An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened, but the Fox calmed his fears. I will talk to him, he said, So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion. Your highness, he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not hear him, I've got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure. The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass. I made him promise not to hurt us, said the Fox. But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone. So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down the traitor Fox.

## THE FOX AND THE STORK 

The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing. You must come and dine with me today, he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite. For dinner the Fox served soup, But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get, But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment. The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly: Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.

## THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD

A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused themselves by disputing about their good looks. The Leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance he declared was quite ordinary. The Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white, but he was wise enough to see that he could not rival the Leopard in looks. Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just to exercise his wits and to have the fun of disputing. The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up, yawning lazily. You may have a very smart coat, he said, but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That's what I call real beauty.

## THE COCK AND THE FOX

One bright evening as the sun was sinking on a glorious world a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost. Before he composed himself to rest, he flapped his wings three times and crowed loudly. But just as he was about to put his head under his wing, his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose, and there just below him stood Master Fox. Have you heard the wonderful news? cried the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner. What news?, asked the Cock very calmly. But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him. for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox. Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it!, I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event. How grand!, said the Cock,I certainly am delighted at the news. But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off. What is it you see? ,asked the Fox a little anxiously. Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and But the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run. Wait, cried the Cock. Why do you run?,The Dogs are friends of yours now! Yes, answered the Fox. But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about. The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.

## THE FOX AND THE GOAT

A Fox fell into a well, and though it was not very deep, he found that he could not get out again. After he had been in the well a long time, a thirsty Goat came by. The Goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink, and so he asked if the water was good. The finest in the whole country, said the crafty Fox, jump in and try it, There is more than enough for both of us. The thirsty Goat immediately jumped in and began to drink. The Fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat's back and leaped from the tip of the Goat's horns out of the well. The foolish Goat now saw what a plight he had got into, and begged the Fox to help him out. But the Fox was already on his way to the woods. If you had as much sense as you have beard, old fellow, he said as he ran, you would have been more cautious about finding a way to get out again before you jumped in.

## THE OLD LION AND THE FOX

An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbors know about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one. The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion's health. The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation. I should be glad to do as you ask, he added, but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?

A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle with the swift current. Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled on him; but he lay quietly, still too weak to run away from them. A Hedgehog happened by. Let me drive the flies away, he said kindly. No, no! exclaimed the Fox, do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left.

## THE CAT AND THE FOX

Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way - a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there - they began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal. You think you are extremely clever, don't you? said the Fox. Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks! Well, retorted the Cat, I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours! Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves. This is my trick, he called to the Fox. Now let me see what yours are worth. But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows, but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.

## THE FOX AND THE PHEASANTS

One moonlight evening as Master Fox was taking his usual stroll in the woods, he saw a number of Pheasants perched quite out of his reach on a limb of a tall old tree. The sly Fox soon found a bright patch of moonlight, where the Pheasants could see him clearly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and began a wild dance. First he whirled round and round like a top, then he hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The Pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of losing him out of their sight a single instant. Now the Fox made as if to climb a tree, now he fell over and lay still, playing dead, and the next instant he was hopping on all fours, his back in the air, and his bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw out silver sparks in the moonlight. By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when the Fox began his performance all over again, so dazed did they become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to the Fox.

At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect a new ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance. This he did so well, with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals were carried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then and there, elected him their king. The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler. One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monkey. The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap. As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to find himself held fast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed. You pretend to be our king, he said, and cannot even take care of yourself! Shortly after that, another election among the Animals was held.

## THE FOX AND THE CROW

One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak. No need to search any farther, thought sly Master Fox. Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast. Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, Good-morning, beautiful creature! The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting. What a charming creature she is! said the Fox. How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds. Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth. Thank you, said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?

## THE LION, THE ASS, AND THE FOX

A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share. The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain. Then he turned to the Fox. You divide it, he roared angrily. The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail. The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely. Who taught you to divide so fairly? he asked pleasantly. I learned a lesson from the Ass, replied the Fox, carefully edging away.

## THE FOX AND THE COCK

A Fox was caught in a trap one fine morning, because he had got too near the Farmer's hen house. No doubt he was hungry, but that was not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discovered what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy. The Fox saw a slender chance of escape. Dear friend, he said, I was just on my way to visit a sick relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled up. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to pieces. But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused the whole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that was the end of Mr. Fox.
